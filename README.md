# student-behavior-analysis
A comprehensive data science project focused on student performance analysis. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a linear regression model to predict academic outcomes based on various factors.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student datasets and implement a **Linear Regression** model to predict final outcomes. It covers everything from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python** (Core language)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation and cleaning)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning modeling)

## 📁 File Structure
The project is divided into three main notebooks for a structured workflow:
1. **students.ipynb**: Data loading, initial inspection, and basic cleaning.
2. **students-2.ipynb**: Statistical analysis and advanced data visualization.
3. **students-3.ipynb**: Feature selection, Linear Regression model training, and performance metrics.
